        <h1>Welcome to the world of Machine Learning.</h1>
        <p>
          Let me take you back about 13 to 18 years ago. You are freshly out the
          womb and know nothing about the world around you.
        </p>
        <p>
          With time, you learn about the world around you through experience and
          growth. It's like the world around you has fed you all the data and
          now you've become this culmination of experiencesâ€¦
        </p>
        <p>
          Well basically, those are computers. Machine Learning is literally in
          its name â€“ your machine learns over time based on data you feed it and
          adapts to patterns, preferences, and behaviors.
