      <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
      <p>
        what is machine learning, how is it used, real life applications, today
        what you’re going to create.
      </p>

      <h2>Creating a repository</h2>
      <p>
        Go to github.com and sign in or login to your account. Create a new
        repository (this is where you store all your code) by pressing the green
        button.
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="Screenshot of GitHub's new repository button." />
      <p>
        After you’ve successfully created a new repository, click on the green
        code button, create a codespace on main, wait for codespaces to set up
        and you’re ready to start coding!
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="Screenshot of GitHub's create codespace button." />

      <h2>Adding some files</h2>
      <p>
        Click that tiny little file button to start adding files in your
        project.
      </p>
      <img
        src=""
        alt="Screenshot of the new file button in the codespace sidebar."
      />
      <p>
        I’m going to add an HTML (basically like a skeleton for your code), CSS
        (the styling! making it pretty!), and JavaScript (used for
        interactivity) files to our codespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's head over to index.html. I could just type the skeleton of my
        website out myself, but I’m kinda lazy. Let's use a shortcut to get a
        boilerplate () to automatically get the anatomy of my code.
      </p>
      <pre><code>! + tab</code></pre>

      <h2>Adding and seeing your code</h2>
      <p>
        In my case, I want to create a machine learning model that can
        differentiate which Hack Club sticker i am holding up. I’m going to add
        a Heading1 Tag to our HTML (&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;) and I’m going to
        write “Hack Club Sticker Classifier” in the tags.
      </p>
      <img
        src=""
        alt="Code snippet showing h1 tag with 'Hack Club Sticker Classifier'."
      />
      <p>
        Amazing! You’ve just written your first lines of code. However, how do
        you see the changes you create?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's head over to Extensions on the left sidebar, then type in Live
        Server.
      </p>
      <img
        src=""
        alt="Screenshot of the Live Server extension in the VS Code marketplace."
      />
      <p>
        Live Server is an extension that allows us to see our code with
        real-time changes in our browser whenever we make changes to our code.
        Click install, (trust the publisher if you get that message), and at the
        bottom right-hand corner, you should see a button that says Go Live!
        This will launch a local server of your website that can only be seen on
        your device. (We’ll go over how to share active links later.)
      </p>
      <p>
        You should see this. Pretty plain, right? We’ll talk more about adding
        CSS later to make your website as unique as you are.
      </p>
      <img
        src=""
        alt="Screenshot of a plain webpage with the h1 title 'Hack Club Sticker Classifier'."
      />

      <h2>Get started</h2>
      <p>
        Open Teachable Machine and get started. Start a new standard image
        project (you can do an audio or pose project, but this tutorial will be
        using images!).
      </p>
      <p>
        In this tutorial, I’ll be using some Hack Club stickers I found lying
        around HQ to train my model. However, you can use literally anything to
        train your model (as long as it's legal).
      </p>
      <p>
        Classes are categories/labels for a data type. These classes are
        essentially the different things you want the model to be able to
        distinguish between.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this tutorial, I’m going to be using a Summer of Making Sticker, a
        Boba Orpheus sticker, and a (not NASA for legal reasons) sticker.
        However, you can (and should) use literally anything to create classes
        of data. I’m going to create three classes and rename them with each of
        the stickers' names.
      </p>
      <img
        src=""
        alt="Screenshot of Teachable Machine interface with three classes named after stickers."
      />

      <h2>Uploading and Understanding Data</h2>
      <p>
        Now it’s time for the ✨data ✨. Data is super duper important to any ML
        model.
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Why is it super important?</summary>
        <p>
          Look at your machine learning model as a newborn baby. A baby has no
          knowledge, so it needs to see different types of people and things to
          independently adapt. Your ML model is a baby right now; you need to
          feed it with data so it learns how to recognize patterns and adapt!
          You can
          <a href="#">read this article</a> if you’re interested in learning
          more.
        </p>
      </details>

      <p>
        You can either upload a bunch of images from your camera roll or you can
        take them on your device.
      </p>
      <img
        src=""
        alt="Screenshot showing options to upload or use webcam for data in Teachable Machine."
      />
      <p>
        Press hold to record a burst of photos. Make sure to get images in a
        diverse environment (different backgrounds, from different angles,
        upside down, inside out – the works!). The more data → the better your
        machine can recognize and adapt to data.
      </p>
      <p>Do the same for the rest of your classes.</p>

      <h2>Training your model!</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you have 2 (or more) different datasets, it’s time to train
        your model!. Click the Train Model button and let Teachable Machine do
        its thing for a few minutes.
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>did you know?</summary>
        <p>

          its development <a href="#">here</a>, or check out this advanced
          tutorial for building an image classifier in python

      <h2>Preview</h2>
      <p>
        When you see something like this in the preview, you should know now you
        have a working Machine Learning Model! Incredible work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Test it out! Put your data up and see if your machine recognizes the
        images or not.
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>machine not recognizing images/not being accurate?</summary>
        <p>
          sometimes, with a lack of diverse data, a machine may not fully
          recognize a type of data. thats why its so so important that we feed
          it diverse data sets in order to have our data represented in the
          world!
